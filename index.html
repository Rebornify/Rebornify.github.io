        <h5>Posted on 25th June 2020</h5>
        <p>As of today, I've completed "Tier X - Programming Prep Prep" of p1xt's guide to Programming and Computer Science and I've began working on "Tier 0 - Web Development
            - Fullstack Bootcamp - App Academy Open". I actually didn't take 2 months to complete it but caved into my procrastination, I took a break from programming and instead spent
             over a month playing League of Legends. On 19th June 2020, Singapore finally enter Phase 2 of Safe Re-opening, I was so excited to finally be able to see my girlfriend.
              Surprisingly, I've yet to be called back to camp, so I really have no excuses to procrastinate further. Note to myself: The next post on this blog would most likely be
               when I complete "Tier 0 - Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - App Academy Open", hopefully it won't take long!</p>

        <p>On 7th April 2020, Singapore essentially began its lockdown due to COVID-19, but it is officially termed "<strong><em>Circuit Breaker</em></strong>". It was initially
            planned to last for a month (guess not, it has been extended by another month). Well, what excuse can I have to not start learning programming. I spent almost a week doing
             my research and contemplating where should I begin, there are so many resources online that it can be overwhelming. I eventually settled with p1xt's guide to Programming
              and Computer Science, and here I am on KhanAcademy.</p>

        <p>My name is Caleb, and I am currently serving the army in Singapore. This project will be a great opportunity to log my progress so far as well as in the future. Mathematics
            have always been my favourite subject in school, but my passion for gaming is just as intense. I was always intrigued by bugs that occur in games, wondering why would it
             happen. After completing my A Levels, I was met with a big decision in my education pathway, what am I going to study in University, Mathematics? What am I going to do
              afterwards? Eventually, I managed to solve the dilemma after coming across Computer Science, encompassing both my passion for Mathematics as well as computing. While serving
               the country, I wanted to pick up programming so I would be better prepared for University, and hence me writing this blog here.</p>
